# Clone Drone In The Danger Zone mod

As the header says, this is a mod for the game "Clone Drone In The Danger Zone".
It targets the version (5/12/2021), so if it doesn't work, it's probably because you're using an older or newer version.

Current features are:
- Infinite Energy (can be toggled on/off using Ctrl+J)
- Get 5 skill points every time you press Ctrl+B

I disabled the steam integration so you can't use this unfair mod on multiplayer.

Any contributions are welcome.

Big thanks to [BepInEx](https://docs.bepinex.dev/index.html) for existing and making the process of creating a mod enjoyable.
