# Clone Drone In The Danger Zone mod

As the header says, this is a mod for the game "Clone Drone In The Danger Zone".
It targets the version (5/12/2021), so if it doesn't work, it's probably because you're using an older or newer version.

Current features are:
- Infinite Energy (can be toggled on/off using Ctrl+J)
- Get 5 skill points every time you press Ctrl+B
- Change the AimTime (slowmo) to 0.2, will only work if you have the upgrade.
- Fly! Just press Ctrl+Space and it will launch you up a bit, do that a lot and you can fly!
- Kill nearest enemy by pressing Ctrl+E!

I disabled the steam integration to avoid any Anti-Cheat detection.

Any contributions are welcome.
